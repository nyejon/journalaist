# A New Addition to the Circle

The sun dipped low, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, as the group gathered around the familiar wooden table at **Central Park's** Bethesda Fountain. The landmark, known for its Angel of the Waters statue, had witnessed their laughter and stories countless times. Today, however, there was an air of anticipation, for they were welcoming a new member into their fold.

The newcomer, introduced as **Alex**, brought a palpable energy to the group. As they shared a picnic feast, the others watched with warmth in their eyes as Alex charmed them with tales of adventures from around the globe. The **photo taken at sunset** captured this moment perfectlyâ€”smiles wide, eyes sparkling with newfound camaraderie, and the iconic fountain as their backdrop. Little did they know, this was just the beginning of many memorable chapters with Alex.

*Central Park's Bethesda Fountain, with its eight-foot bronze angel, is one of the largest fountains in New York. Designed by Emma Stebbins in 1868, it commemorates the Croton water system, which provided the city with fresh water.*
