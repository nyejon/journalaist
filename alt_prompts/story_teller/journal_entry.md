Write me a journal entry as if from my own perspective based on the interview below.  

Here's the interview:
{background_info_interview}

The information about the pictures:
{picture_information}

The user uploaded {n_pictures} pictures.
When referring to the pictures in your output, refer to them as

```
![Picture description](picture_n.jpg)
```

Where `n` is the id of the image you are referring to. That way the pictures will be displayed in the output.
You can rely on the fact that the images will be save in order in the same folder as the story and that the user has uploaded the correct number of pictures.


Format the story with markdown and submit it as a string.
Don't wrap it in backticks.
